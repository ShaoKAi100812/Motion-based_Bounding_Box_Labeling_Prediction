# Motion-based Bounding Box Labeling Prediction 
Assisting Annotation Tool for Simple-motion Video Data with Low Labeling Cost

## main goal
Make preliminary bounding box prediction based on "frames' difference" data

## function planning
- [x] Object extraction from dataset with certain classes and numbers
- [x] Image extension for sequential image set simulation
- [x] Frame difference data generation
- [ ] ~~External input for absolute xy position (ground truth for position prediction)~~
- [x] Vector data generation (ground truth for vector prediction)
- [x] Tranfer data from Tensor to DataLoader
- [x] Deep learning model building
- [x] Training / Testing function
- [x] Quality validation function
- [ ] ~~Visualization function~~
